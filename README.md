# Automated_Aquaponics_System

The purpose of this project, that was also the subject of my diploma thesis, was to implement an automated hydration system using sensors and the IoT and to display data in an Android application. The aim of the system was to record the environmental conditions and do all the necessary actions automatically. For optimal system operation, a vertical aquaponic facility was recommended to save space, with a pump that circulates water from the fish tanks and electronic valves that channel it to the plants. Finally, the water returned filtered back to the tanks resulting in water savings, organic vegetable production and harmonious coexistence of plants and fish.
